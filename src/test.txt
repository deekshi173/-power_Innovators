# Power Manager Telemetry - Test Instructions

## Overview
This file contains instructions for testing the Power Manager Telemetry project. The tests evaluate the functionality of the telemetry data collection and power measurement.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Ensure you have DockerDesktop installed (if applicable for load simulation).

## Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Run the `power_manager_telemetry.py` script.
   - Input various system utilization percentages (0-100) and verify that the output power values make sense (e.g., they should not exceed logical limits based on your simulated range).

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Input invalid values (e.g., negative numbers, values over 100) and ensure the program handles these gracefully (e.g., by prompting for valid input).

3. **Load Simulation** (if applicable):
   - Use Docker to run a containerized application that generates load on the system.
   - Collect telemetry data during high utilization scenarios and validate the output.

## Expected Outputs
- The script should print telemetry data in the following format:
  ```
  Telemetry Data:
  CPU Power (W): X.XX W
  Memory Power (W): Y.YY W
  NIC Power (W): Z.ZZ W
  TDP Power (W): A.AA W
  ```

## Running Tests
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd power-manager-telemetry
   ```
3. Run the test script:
   ```
   python power_manager_telemetry.py
   ```

4. Follow prompts and verify outputs against expected values.

## Notes
- Make sure to document any anomalies or unexpected behavior during testing.
- Add any additional testing information as needed.

```

### Tips:
- Be clear and concise in your instructions.
- Include any specific commands or configurations needed to run tests.
- Consider adding examples of expected output to guide users.
- Update the file as your project evolves to keep it accurate and useful. 

This structured approach will help collaborators and users understand how to test your Power Manager Telemetry project effectively.
